This is a series of images to use as overlays for your maps.  You will need to combine them with a lighting plugin.

It's very likely that the lighting maps won't work too well right out of the box.  They're made extra-large so that you have plenty of room to trim and fit them properly to your map.  You can try them as they are, but they may bog down your game because they are very large.

We included several variations of each design (plus layered PSDs) so you can see what works best for you, including adding colors.  

If you need any help, let us know.
